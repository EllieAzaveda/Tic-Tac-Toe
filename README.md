# Tic Tac Toe Solo Project

Who doesn't love a good game of Tic-Tac-Toe! Kick back and play a relaxing game with a friend with this tropical paradise themed Tic-Tac-Toe app!

Throughout the project, my main focus was to provie a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, I reled on JavaScript to implement high quality game interaction in the browser, and `localStorage` to maintain both player's win counts so the competition will get fierce!

## Learning Goals

* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a logical challenge

## Functionality
*Tic Tac Toe: a web app play tic-tac-toe, as well as store and display user wins*

#### Fully functional game board for two players
- This Tic-Tac-Toe board is ready for relaxed or intense competition between any two competitors willing to take on the challenge in this tropical island version of Tic-Tac-Toe. We've graduated from Xs and Os, so grab your shades and a Mai Thai and decide whether you want to lounge under a shady palm tree or under an umbrella by the water!

#### Status bar above the board
- You will always know who's turn it is with the status bar above the board. Just remember where you've kicked your feet up and the game will tell you the rest!

#### Timed reset
- You don't even have to make an effort to play a new game, so keep your cocktail in hand and the board will reset in just seconds! Just enough time to get a refill!

#### Updated win count in asides
- Are you competitive? Don't worry! You will know exactly where you stand with your total win count right under your player at all times. It will even update after the board refreshes so you will never forget!

#### Web Accessibility
- Our application has fully implemented HTML that is accessible for individuals with visual disabilities. Our application passes the WAVE audit tool.

#### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

#### Styling Guides Used
- Turing Style Guides
- Single-Responsibility Principle
- SMACCS

#### Future Iterations
- In future iterations, I would like to add a hover feature over each box so users can see exactly where their emoji will be placed. I would also like to add a pop up or confetti/glitter explosion feature when a player wins. I'd like for players to be able to choose their player token from a list of options rather than just having two set options. I'm interested in getting more creative with the CSS in the future as well. I'd love to have the entire screen be more interactive, including things like looking into your win stats, see if you had a certain number of win streaks, or how many days in a row you've played. I
