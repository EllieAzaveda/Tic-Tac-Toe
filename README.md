# Tic Tac Toe Solo Project

<!-- Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and `localStorage` to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions. -->

## Learning Goals

* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a logical challenge
